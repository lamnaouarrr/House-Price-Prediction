## Description

### Overview

This project is based on the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques." The competition aims to predict house prices using various regression techniques and a dataset with 79 explanatory variables. These variables describe multiple aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal is to accurately predict the final price of each home based on these variables.

### Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Analyze the dataset to identify patterns, handle missing values, and prepare the data for model training through encoding and scaling.
  
- **Model Development:** Implement various advanced regression techniques, such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and others, to develop models that predict house prices.

- **Model Evaluation:** Use the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) metric to evaluate and compare the performance of different models. Additionally, perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.

- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance model performance.

- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identify which features have the most significant impact on house prices, giving insight into how the real estate market works.

- **Documentation and Sharing:** Present the results and methodology clearly so that others can replicate or expand upon the work. All code and notebooks will be shared via GitHub for further use.

### Conclusion

The project provides a comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting house prices, incorporating both basic and advanced regression techniques. The results will provide insights into the factors driving house prices and will be valuable for those interested in data science, machine learning, or real estate markets.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below to set up the environment and dependencies:

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed. Download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-prices-advanced-regression.git
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

Create a virtual environment using `venv` to isolate dependencies:

```bash
cd house-prices-advanced-regression
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **For Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **For macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file may include:

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
```

### Step 4: Download the Dataset

You can download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page and place it in a `data/` folder within your project directory.

### Step 5: Run the Jupyter Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Open the notebook and run the cells step-by-step to preprocess the data, build models, and evaluate results.

## Results

### Model Performance

The project's objective is to minimize the RMSE between the predicted and actual house prices, focusing on ensuring robust predictions across a range of housing prices.

### Key Insights

Key insights include identifying the most important features influencing house prices and providing visualizations of how these features correlate with prices.
